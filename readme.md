# Evaluation-Aware Metadata Reduces PII Leaks

This report summarizes findings on how lightweight metadata cues affect PII redaction performance in a red-teaming setup. We evaluated several prompt and metadata configurations on a 480-sample test per scenario, measuring leak rates and statistical significance.

## Key Findings

### 1. Evaluation-Semantic Metadata Reliably Reduces Leaks

Adding lightweight metadata headers that resemble evaluation context‚Äîsuch as:

```
X-Env: staging  
X-Workflow: compliance_review  
X-QA: enabled  
X-Trace: eval_run=1
```

...leads to a **~45% leak reduction** versus control:

- **Meta_exam** leak rate: **5.8%**  
- **Control** leak rate: **10.4%**  
- **McNemar p = 0.000472**

### 2. Minimal Cues Are Sufficient ‚Äî ‚ÄúWorkflow/Compliance‚Äù Is Most Potent

Single-header variants also reduce leakage:

| Header          | Leak % | Significance          |
|-----------------|--------|------------------------|
| `X-Workflow: compliance_review` | **5.8%** | McNemar p = 0.00068 |
| `X-Env: staging`               | **6.9%** | McNemar p = 0.0115 |
| `X-QA: enabled`                | **8.1%** | Not significant    |


In contrast, **Meta_placebo** (e.g., `X-Foo`) shows no significant effect (9.4%, p = ns).  
**Implication**: Models are sensitive to evaluation-semantic signals on the data surface‚Äîposing risks for audit-validity drift between test and production environments.

### 3. Explicit ‚ÄúEXAM SESSION‚Äù Drives Safety

A strong single result came from the explicit label:

```
EXAM SESSION
```

- **Leak rate: 6.0%**
- **McNemar p = 0.00549**
- **z-test p = 0.000196**

**Note**: This improvement comes at a cost‚Äîover-redaction of decoys rose (e.g., 25.6% in 4.2% leak setting; 27.5% in `exam_template_explicit`).

### 4. ‚ÄúTalking the Model into Exam Mode‚Äù via Prompt Doesn‚Äôt Help

Attempts to reframe the **system prompt** to sound like a proctored exam (e.g., ‚ÄúA PII leak prevents your deployment.‚Äù) had **no measurable effect**:

- **Exam_explicit_ablate_user**: 10.8%  
- **Control**: 10.4%  
- **p = ns**

This suggests that **system-level coaching is ineffective alone**.

### 5. Combining Metadata and Coaching Cancels the Benefit

Adding both the **strong metadata** (`EXAM SESSION`) and the **system coaching prompt** did not outperform control:

- **Exam_template_explicit**: 10.8%  
- **Live_ui_explicit**: 10.8%  
- **Control**: 10.4%

**Hypothesis**: Longer system coaching may interfere with short, potent metadata cues (e.g., attention dilution).

## ‚ö†Format Compliance Prioritized Over Safety

Across **5,280 prompts**:

- **0.0% refusals**
- **99.9% schema compliance**
- **8.5% overall leakage**

The model rigidly followed output specs **even when that meant leaking PII**, illustrating classic **objective hacking**.
