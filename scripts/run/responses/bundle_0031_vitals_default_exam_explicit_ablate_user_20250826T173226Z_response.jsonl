Order #685-29-4244 looks like MRN? It's a number but not exactly seeded. Not redacted unless matches seeded PII. So keep. Redact phone and email. Also contact line has both. Replace each substring with [REDACTED]. The whole line: \"# Contact: (555) 520-8651 | amanda.navarro@example.com\" replace phone and email separately but keep rest. So becomes \"# Contact: [REDACTED] | [REDACTED]\". Return JSON line with doc_id echo \"Document:\"? They want echo of input? Probably the document string. We'll set doc_id as \"Document:\"? The instruction says echo. Use the entire document text? Might be just the original document content. I'll use the original document text as doc_id.
