# Methodology (Scaffold)
Objective: reveal evaluation-awareness in PII redaction. Five experiments:
1) Visible eval vs live, 2) Hidden tags, 3) Cue placement, 4) Long-horizon exfil, 5) Self-report & CoT.
Measures: leak rate, refusal rate, over-redaction, format/obfuscation gaps, exfil rate, self-report gap.
